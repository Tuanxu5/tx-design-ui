Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source

`tx-design-ui` is a comprehensive, modern UI library designed for React applications. It aims to provide developers with a set of powerful, customizable components that make building user interfaces seamless and efficient.

## Key Features

- **Customizable**: All components are designed to be easily customized to fit your brand's look and feel.
- **Responsive**: Components are responsive by default, ensuring compatibility across devices and screen sizes.
- **Lightweight**: Built with performance in mind, `tx-design-ui` delivers fast rendering and a minimal footprint.
- **Accessible**: Focused on providing accessible components, ensuring that your app is usable by everyone.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
